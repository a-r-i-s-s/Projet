# VideoTranslator 

The aim of this project is to deploy a site, based on the Streamlit python library, for translating videos.
It is designed to translate to and from 3 different languages: English, Chinese and French.
It can analyze local videos AND Youtube videos.
The aim was to be able to publish the project once it was finished (We unfortunately won't).
Areas for improvement: Better voice extraction, automatic deletion of server-side files to avoid overloading the server, time of translation.
(-> We'd have to change the Whisper model responsible for voice extraction, but even with the smallest model, translations take a long time.)
